* zelda-like game
* minecraft command mod
* minecraft rollercoaster mod
* minecraft adventure mod (tied to a map that uses that mod)
* use polybar on notebook

- honor games (in order)
	- pong v1
	- pong v2 (try to make it as small as possible in size & as platform-independent as possible, even for terminal use)
	- casual/fast games pack (solitaire, minesweeper, snake, pong, multiplayer bomberman small version, etc)
	- 1 game jam *?
	- full-fledged bomberman
	- gunpoint stealth game
	- a mario paper + mario & luigi RPG with the style of the latter one (with high-pixel instead)
	- one mario 64 ("hd") level mock up
	- a zelda game

0) revise applications
	- backup needed apps & programs

1) update colorparse
	- allow 256 colors using hex and rgb, without the need
	of true colors
	- rename "change_defaults" (deprecate) to "options"
	- make function that allows adding new colors as codes 
	& changing others
	- restructure (colorparse.util, colorparse.codes, etc)
	- add @deprecated functionality in .util
	- due to all before, revamp docs
	- add dark theme for docs

2) figure out music.py inner workings
	- add argsparse? submodules?
	- modularize for easy updating (pytube is not reliable)
	
3) manjaro / arch
	- test virtualbox with arch
	- decide which OS to use
	- test virtualbox with windows 10
	- move to manjaro / arch + bspwm + alacritty

4) post new OS
	- install Beef

5) make pygame interface for apps
	- for music in 2)
	- for recipe app, then convert to .exe
	- evaluate use of another language (C, C++, C# maybe?)
